(1) Used accessible and intuitive colours such as using red for error messages, green for confirmation, and other contrasting but cohesive colours for important buttons/text (e.g., publishing a listing, viewing reservations)

(3) Using pattern affordance such as + and - buttons to imply an increase or decrease in the number of features (see creation of bedrooms/baths and sleeping arrangements in new listings)

(4) Using an accordion group to show and hide individual bedroom sleeping arrangements.

(5) Using MUI containers which employ Grid layouts (i.e., the division of a page into 12 blocks) to provide a cohesive and systematic layout of our pages and also restricts the width of the content size for improved readability across the page.

(6) Asserting cursor pointers over clickable links. While buttons and links were naturally implemented, we also manually override element such as the Airbnb logo when hovered over in the navbar to indicate the presence of a clickable element.

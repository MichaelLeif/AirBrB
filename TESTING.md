unauthorisedFlow.cy.js:
  This specific happy path was developed so that it shows a general use
  of the site and the limitations it has. This happy path was chosen to
  show that owners who may try to book their own listings cannot succeed.
  It first begins with the user making an account then registering their
  own listing. The user then explores the site and its capabilities. The
  user tries to find limitations in the site and tries to book their own
  listing. However, it wasn't successful and the user deletes their listing
  and logs out. This path was chosen as there may be a user who behaves this
  way to test a sites functionality and capabilities.
